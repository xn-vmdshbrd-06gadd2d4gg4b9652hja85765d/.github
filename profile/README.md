About Copilot

Copilot for Mac is a next-generation productivity and AI assistant application built for creatives, developers, analysts, and everyday users. With advanced AI at its core, Copilot transforms the way you work, write, code, and think — directly from your Mac.

It’s designed to reduce friction and increase output by combining natural language understanding with real-time processing.
